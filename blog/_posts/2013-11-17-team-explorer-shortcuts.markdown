Visual Studio 2013 has a re-designed Team Explorer, and I really like it, but I sometimes find some options, such as "Find Shelvesets" and "New Query", to be buried away. 

For example, the normal path I have to take to find a shelveset is:

 - Pending Changes
 - Actions
 - Find Shelvesets
 
This is really "clicky" and something I wished I could do quicker.
Today I found out I could right-click on the tiles on the Team Explorer Home Page to get to some of those actions that are buried away:<br />
# Pending Changes
From Pending Changes you can get to Find Shelvesets

# Work Items
From Work Items you can get to "New Query"

# My Work
From My Work you can get to Request Review

# Team Members
If you have the TFS 2013 Power Tools installed, then even the Team Members gets the right-click treatment with access to "Team Utilities"
