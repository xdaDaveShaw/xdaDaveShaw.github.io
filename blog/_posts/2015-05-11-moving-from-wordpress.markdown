This is my last post on WordPress and first post on Jekyll GitHub Pages.

I've decided to abandom WordPress running on Azure Web Apps for a simpler static blog using Jekyll to convert Markdown to static content hosted on GitHub pages. I'll go into the process I went though in a future post.

This posts is here as a marker of when I moved everything over. I've tried to get the permalinks in Jekyll to match the ones in WordPress - but breaking any that were from my breif stint on DasBlog. As far as I know everything should just be the same - including the RSS feed on `/feed`. 

Shoot me a mail if there is a problem.

Everything from this point on will be on the new format.
