Scott Hanselman has just posted on his [blog](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/MakeAWindows81PinnedLiveTileForYOURWebsiteInMinutes.aspx) about how easy it is to get a Windows 8 / 8.1 Live Tile for your own site. At the bottom he posted a link to the [Custom Windows Pinned Tiles](http://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-windows-pinned-tiles/) plugin for WordPress by [Nick Hasley](http://celloexpressions.com/about/)

I thought I'd give it a go, and after a few minutes of clicking, and a little hacking in Paint.net to make an icon, I now have a live tile that displays updates of from my RSS feed:

![Storage]({{ site.contenturl }}LiveTile.png)

This really was easy, a big thanks to Nick for this awesome plugin.

**Update 2015**

Since migrating to Jekyll, this has been broken, I'll look into fixing this one day.
