> This post is part of the [F# Advent Calendar 2018][1].

So this year I decided to write something for the F# Advent Calendar, and even though I picked a date far enough in the future, panic still set in.
I'm not one for "ideas on demand", and after a bit of deliberating about Xmas themed games, I finally settled on something that let me explore my favourite parts of F#:

- Domain Modelling
- Testing
- Event Sourcing
- Fable & Elmish

## The Concept

My initial design was for something a bit more complicated, but I scaled it down into simple Web App for Santa to record child, who's been Naughty and who's been Nice, and what presents Nice children are getting, along with an overall list of all the presents he needs to sent to the elves.
