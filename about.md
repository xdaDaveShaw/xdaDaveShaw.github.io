I work as a Lead Developer working on Healthcare Software for over 20 years.

I've worked in [Micronetics Standard MUMPS 4 (MSM)][msm], [Delphi 6][delphi], then C#, WinForms, and Microsoft SQL 
Server.
Today, I am still using C#, but with ASP.NET Core and AWS.

I'm also learning (and loving) F# and functional programming and finding excuses to use it at work.

In a past life, I've also spend a lot of time managing Team Foundation Server / Azure DevOps.

I plan to share some of my experience that I hope you will find useful. Topics that I have in mind for coverage:

- C# & F#.
- Software Development
- "Devopsy" stuff
- Team Foundation Server/Visual Studio Team Services (including the API) - probably less nowadays.

I live in the [Holme Valley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holme_Valley).
