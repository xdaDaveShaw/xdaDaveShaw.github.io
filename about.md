I work full-time as a lead developer for a large software firm, working with C#, WinForms and Microsoft SQL Server on an enterprise scale. I am also the “Accidental TFS Admin” for TFS 2012 within the company. I'm currently learning F# and finding excuses to use it at work.

I plan to share some of my experience that I hope you will find useful. Topics that I have in mind for coverage:

 - Team Foundation Server/Service (including the API).
 - Useful Linqpad snippets.
 - Windows Phone 8 Development Journey – as I write this, I have not left port, so I will share useful facts as I find them.
 - C#.
 - Unit Testing.

I live in the [Holme Valley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holme_Valley) / Huddersfield area of Yorkshire in the United Kingdom.

I’m not a fan of [blog comments](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/07/20.html) (although I actively use them when people offer them, call me a hypocrite).

If you want to contact me about a blog post, or in general, you can find me on social media (see the links at the top), or e-mail dave [at] this site.
