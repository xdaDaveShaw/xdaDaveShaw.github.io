I work full-time as a lead developer for a health care software firm.

- My role focussed on using C#, WinForms, and Microsoft SQL Server for many years.
- I'm also learning (and loving) F# and functional programming and
finding excuses to use it at work.
- In a past life, I've also spend a lot of time managing Team Foundation Server / Azure Devops.

I plan to share some of my experience that I hope you will find useful. Topics that I have in mind for coverage:

- C# & F#.
- Software Development
- "Devopsy" stuff
- Team Foundation Server/Visual Studio Team Services (including the API) - probably less nowadays.

I live in the [Holme Valley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holme_Valley) / Huddersfield area of Yorkshire in the United Kingdom.
